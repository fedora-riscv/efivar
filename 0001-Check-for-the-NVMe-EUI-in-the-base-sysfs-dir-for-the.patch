Subject: [PATCH] Check for the NVMe EUI in the base sysfs dir for the device
 as well

Kernel commit 779ff75617099f4defe14e20443b95019a4c5ae8 moves the NVMe
attributes from being under nvme0n1/device/* to just being in the
nvme0n1/ directory.  So now we get to check for both things.  Thanks,
sysfs.

This resolves github issue #65
This resolves https://github.com/rhinstaller/efibootmgr/issues/48
